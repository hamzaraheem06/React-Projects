A react component always starts with an uppercase character, this differs it from the normal html elements. e.g.. An heading HTML element would be <h1></h1>, however a react component will start with an uppercase letter e.g. <MyButton />.
here MyButton is a function, also called a component, that would be returning HTML elements. e.g. 

function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>I'm a button</button>
  );
}

To use this component we will write it in an other function as <MyButton />

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}
